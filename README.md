# urbansound8k_classification
Do a task of classification on dataset UrbanSound8K with Pytorch framework. We mainly use VGG or ResNet.

This program's structure is based on https://github.com/victoresque/pytorch-template.

You need to download dataset UrbanSound8K first, which is available from here https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html.
And then extract all wav files to the folder "UrbanSound8K". genData.py is just used to filter data which I need.
